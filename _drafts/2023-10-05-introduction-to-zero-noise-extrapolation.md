title: "Introduction to zero-noise extrapolation"
subtitle: "Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is an error mitigation technique that
allows us to amplify noise in a quantum circuit then extrapolate from that
what the expectation value would be if there was no (zero) noise.
This post follows a paper from Unitary Fund to explain the technical details
of ZNE and presents some sample code as to its implementation and application."
